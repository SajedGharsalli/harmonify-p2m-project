### Some tips 
- use [``prettier``](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) for code formatting, the code you wrote is kinda messy.
``prettier`` is industry standard
- u made a mistake with git, you actually uploaded the ``node_modules`, which is heavy af, use `.gitignore` to ignore it next time you upload node projects 
- I like how you used ``.env``, big ups! 
- here's an [example](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) express app, that uses the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) model like u did here.
look up how they implement this architecture.
- implement [best practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html) when it comes to logging.
